Freelancing has many perks. For me, freelancing is an opportunity to gather experience and become a better writer without committing myself to any firm. The current situation is that big companies want employees to be experienced. How is it possible to get experience if no-one is hiring you without +3 years of experience in a similar position? The result is that newly graduated marketing students like me have huge difficulties to get even a decent job. Small startup companies might not be able to afford to hire you if they are unable to give you enough work to be full day worker. Personally, I am bored of being unpaid (a half-salary trainee) and trying to get more names for my resume.

The world is changing so fast that it is hard to handle if you are not interested in it on a day-to-day basis. The digital world gives opportunities to everyone. Freelancing gives you an opportunity to work for multiple growing startups and small or medium sized companies which are more than willing to pay for your help. The better you do, the more you make a name for yourself. With a wide network of talented, sharpened, result driven minds you could get profitable projects until the end of your life. Sounds good, doesn’t it?

My target while trying to become a better marketer is producing content. I hated writing as a kid, but many years later I have found out that writing is the easiest way for me to express myself. I have tried music, sports and bit of dancing as well with poor results. I always found myself unable to let it all out. I am not perfect when it comes to grammar but whenever I get inspiration for writing it comes more or less naturally. I have always read a lot all my life which helps a lot. Content marketing is the entrepreneur’s key for better SEO results, which become leads, and finally an action – contacts are given or an item is bought.

Freelancing is the best way to make a name for yourself and it is possible that you could earn way better than you could otherwise. It might even be your baby steps to becoming an entrepreneur or consultant to be hired for big companies.
