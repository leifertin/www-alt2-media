There are many advantages of good old teamwork. Still I see many people who would rather going on by themselves. Together with your network of friends you can create your own opportunities. Here you need to be flexible of course; The best thing would be to start working with 2 to 4 buddies who have always been there for you. That is a great core of your network. As you start building off of a good brother network, you are going to need a various set of skills. They don’t always need to be business related. You never know when you are going to need a good mechanic to help out with car trouble or a decent metal worker to hand-craft a prototype. With a business network it might seem useful to sharpen up the mindset by challenging yourself somehow. Innovation competitions, startup events, and everything to get your thoughts to the next level.

Friends have friends and if you are not a full asshole towards everyone else (other than your pals) they will help you as well if you ask them nicely. Just have a decent amount of skills close enough so you can ask them to assist you with their own expertise. Cover yourself with layers. Together you can be a onion of useful skills and anyone who has ever cut an onion knows it makes you cry. We all know people who seem to be a specialist in everything, but these are the same guys who suffer from a nervous meltdown in the end.

You just need to be friendly. You need to socialise. You need to be open to new people. If I ever have a party I usually invite only a few friends because usually they will invite their own friends (people I have not met before). Whenever they call me and ask if they can bring some friends I always say: "Go on. Bring everyone you want." This gives me opportunities to meet new people with useful skills. I don't have an opinion on which skills are useful or not, because I believe they are all useful. Being social often comes with a burden. Not everyone who wants to talk with you sees the world through the same eyes as you do. Being social often requires us to be able to respect other mindsets which we find hard to support. Just keep your network free from assholes.  It will ruin the atmosphere you need to be able to work together. You don't need to like everyone. What's more important is that you get along with each other and are able to work together.

This highway goes both ways. If they ask you anything you must be ready to return the favour. Usually we do things for each other like assisting during a move, helping out with the lighting, or chopping wood for winter. Mutual understanding helps every one of you and keeps your network alive.
