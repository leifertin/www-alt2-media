<p>
Participating and the experience itself is reward enough. Your efforts are not useless even if you won’t be in the winning team. During all of my final presentations I have always been so psyched from our innovation and been sure we nailed it. Seeing presentations from other groups has usually been cure for that. Other groups have always been able to solve problems as innovatively as us and many times I have cursed myself from not thinking in that way. Ask questions! Be interested in the ideas of others. Don’t use all your efforts to shoot them down. Remember that they have also given all their effort to polish the diamond of their own. Judges will usually know what they are doing and every time the winner has been a total surprise for all the participants. Even the winners themselves are usually confused about why they won and at a loss of words when asked to give a small speech.
