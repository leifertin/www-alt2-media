I have participated in a large amount of innovation courses, competitions, workshops, and hackathons​; Because of this I have vast experience on how to get 100% team performance. Unfortunately I know how it feels to realize that all the effort we put into our work has not been enough. Someone has always outsmarted us with a better idea pushed a bit further than ours. I have not won anything yet. But it won’t keep me from trying again as the competitions themselves have been great experiences. I encourage everyone to participate in such events and go there to have fun; Test your limits. But remember that to win events of this nature you also need a lot of luck to succeed. I could write pages from my mistakes and try to find all the wrong turns on our projects, but instead I will give you some tips to get all out of the experience itself. In the end you will find out that winning is overrated if you have fun while losing.

<div class="article-break">The first step is to create a team.</div>

<p>
First you need a team with ambition and with members who are willing to work together under the tremendous pressure which is created by difficult assignments, a tight schedule and too little if any time to sleep. Readiness to give everything to the team is important. Group chemistry is also an important thing. If there are individuals in the group it does not work - together everyone achieves more. There is no time for long disagreements in 24 hours.

You might get some useful hints or material to read. If so, be sure that everyone within your group reads those before hand. It might be useful to have a conversation about it as well. Teamwork theories like forming, norming, storming and performing is useful stuff to know as well. Libraries have loads of books with useful tips to make your team effort and innovation game stronger. You should bring some books with you as well. Do some online research as well. Save useful links and bookmarks with some notions. You could share a folder in cloud service. Make sure everyone has a laptop or tablet to work with. Borrowing is possible. Everyone must be able to work effectively.

<div class="article-break">What do you do when team is getting nowhere and everyone thinks their idea and working method is best?</div>

<p>
Take a break. It could be five or fifteen minutes. Just take a break. Then everyone should go out and walk by themselves and think about new ways to resolve the matter. I have witnessed many times how the chemistry of the group has gotten sour and no-one enjoys working together. The best thing you can do is to give each other space. For many of us it would also be important to know when to backup. When to push no further. Respect others' ideas as if they were your own and try to see things from their point of view. In the end all the ideas of the group are valuable and will help you to polish your diamond.

<div class="article-break">Remember to DRINK!</div>

<p>
An important way to have fun at the 24-hour innovation competition is to remain hydrated. Don’t drink only coffee - it will dry you up even more and the next morning you will be sick of it. Remember to drink water, cola, or even a couple of beers as long as you are still able to work with full power. Try to relax even though deadlines often seem to be ready to punch you in the face. With most of my teams we have always found time for sauna. The time spent together relaxing and interacting with each other has always been time well spent. If you smoke prepare to have extra packs with you. No one wants to be with you in the same space if you run out. Plan what you are going to eat during your insane effort ahead of time. Having some snacks helps you and your group to stay awake. Some exercise is also a good way to keep your brains active. But don't count up calories in this event. After having more efforts like this you will learn your limits. You know if pizza makes you sleepy or if Tex-Mex makes you gassy. Keep your head clear and be smart.
