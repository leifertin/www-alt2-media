<p>
Social selling is the hottest topic right now. Most of us are doing social selling without ever thinking about it. Our work egos have experienced a fusion with our free time ego. You and me are both thinking how our social media channels are implementing our personal brand. Is the message we are giving lined up with our professional image? Most recently I have read and heard a lot from social selling with basically making digital sales. Becoming the expert of your own field and use your LinkedIn network to boost it up. Making your personal brand look professional in your own field.

The idea of social selling comes from the fact that if a salesman and a possible client share common interests, the beginning of customer relationship is more likely. Common interests and perhaps even state of mind gives better tools to communicate and by that to build trust.

While going into the social selling it is important to point out clear differences among social medias. As in social selling it seems to be important to know what kind of message you are putting on different channels. 
</p>

<p>
Let's start from the biggest social media - Facebook. Facebook is by far the biggest channel in social media right now and vast majority of the world has a Facebook profile. While building your professional brand on Facebook it is good to remember that in Facebook many of us are entering in “kitty video mode.” Facebook is supposed to belong in our after work free time, when last thing you want to do is to think about work. As you are doing social selling on Facebook you should participate in conversation but don’t get provoked into an argument. Other important thing is to remain human while on Facebook. The most effective way to ruin someone else's “kitty video mode” is to stumble on abusive content. Don’t get yourself into a situation where you can’t get out from.

Instagram is another important channel of social selling. Here you have best possibility to set free your off track personality. Get a little crazy with behind the scenes material. Make sure your pictures are high quality stuff with attractive visual touch. You shouldn’t put too much effort in text or choosing the right hashtags and one more thing… no links!

LinkedIn seems to be the place for setting up your social selling profile. This is the place for your pro level content which no one would be interested to read in their free time. Take part in conversation or start up your own. By discussing from the matters of your interests try to learn from others as much as you are giving in return. Your actions in LinkedIn are a perfect way to build trust for your professional image. While you post something here put links in the comment section. This will provide a lot more views for your post.

The fourth useful channel for social selling is Twitter. Here you can provide your expertise among your followers in real time. Conversations will happen rather quickly and are often forgotten rather quickly. Still channels like Twitter and Snapchat are great tools to raise awareness of your professionalism.

Publish regularly in the style suitable for the channel. This will give you new opportunities to trigger sales by showing of your commitment and belief in what you are doing. Your professional network will soon become the in-group for your message. This will lead to affiliate marketing where you have become an expert of your own field and people around will recommend you for the people outside your own network.
