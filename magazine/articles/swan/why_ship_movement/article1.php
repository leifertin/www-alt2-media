</p>

<p>
If you are not prepared, we will prepare you.<br>
If you need a direction, we will give you one.<br>
If you need a team, we will introduce you to one.
</p>

<p>
Are you ready for some “disruptive” adventure? Step out of your comfort zone and hop on our ship!
</p>

<div class="article-break">I will give you a few reasons why you should join our camp.</div>

<p>
Firstly, we are not here to work 24/7, this camp is organized for people who want to have fun while working. It might sound strange and illogical but I am confident that I can convince you to believe in what I have to say. If you are wondering about the word “disruption”, worry not, I am here to help you with everything. 
</p>

<p>
Pressure can be applied in many situations to motivate people, but do you agree with me fun is way better and healthier? That is one way of defining disruption. The word itself has a powerful meaning. Think of how many ways you can solve an algebra equation; You can do the same with explaining the definition of “disruption”.
</p>

<p>
Here at SHIP, we are very much fond of a healthy routine. We like to have fun, we want to have fun, and we create a joyful working environment for each other. Would you like to try and invent one for yourself and help others build their own? Don’t be afraid of change - we change for the greater good. Don’t hesitate to bring disruption into existence. You are unique, your ways of thinking are distinctive, you are disruptive already. You are creativity.
</p>

<div class="article-break">Have you ever asked yourself how to become more creative?</div>

<p>
If yes, from where do you get the inspiration to do such a thing? If no, what should you do?
I think everybody can inspire one another. Maybe you haven’t realized that your graphic design work inspires 5 complete strangers, but the fact that you love what you are doing has already made an impact on other people to find their own motivation. Why am I talking about inspiration instead of creativity? Because to us, inspiration is one of the factors that will contribute a big part to you becoming disruptive. And if you are lost, we are here to give you a direction with open minds and open arms. At SHIP, you are inspiring and being inspired.
</p>

<p>
With such motivation and your amazing character, you will grow in the most incredible ways of which you can think. You will start looking at things from different perspectives and thinking more boldly. You are developing your new skills and you handle problems more with flexibility. With a specific skills set, you are able to cope with new challenges. 
</p>

<p>
We provide you with direct company contacts as well as your space so you can freely express your personalities, your abilities, and your leadership. The local companies around the Kotka area are always looking for young talent, though you don't necessarily have to be young to participate. We are looking for passionate, young souls, adventurous minds, and devoted hands.
</p>

<div class="article-break">You will not be working alone.</div>

<p>
We will introduce you to a team with different people, who have very diverse skills and different specializations, just like you. We believe in the power of teamwork, friendship, fellowship, and leadership. We want to give the best environment to work in, the best tools to work with and the best people to learn from by working together. This way, not only can you enjoy your working hours, but also create your own network with everyone. The more people you have beside you, the more disruptive you all can become. You are all different with a variety of personalities and abilities, and together, you make possibilities a reality. You make the future even greater.
