Last but not least, your hard work will be certified. You will receive your hard-earned credits from your disruption. Yes, at SHIP, if we can be disruptive about the way we work, then we can be the same in encouraging all of the amazingness that you all brought on board with us. We appreciate you in the heart, in the mind, and on paper too!
