In late 2014, Jouni Eho (Director of Business Services, in Cursor, regional development company since 2016) ran a project where he sought for ways to develop the entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial activities in the Kymenlaakso region. When Antti Viitanen (*ship Captain) got involved, he was working on developing a better entrepreneurial ecosystem for students at the local university. Jouni took the first steps by inviting a bunch of students, some local companies, and city representatives to a workshop to figure out what they could do. Professor Shai Vyakarnam (*ship mentor 2015) came up with the idea of having a cruise ship in Kotka, called entrepreneurSHIP. People got excited about this idea of stacking a boat full of startups and investors and sailing them out to the sea. That's how *ship came into existence.

<p>
During research done by Jouni, he found out that creating an impactful event tremendously facilitates in creating a startup culture locally - just look at the impact Slush has had on Finland. This gave the organizers confidence to create a big event to celebrate entrepreneurship.

<p>
Before *ship, Antti was working on his own business. Later on he was asked to take the lead of *ship with PatteriES. Antti immediately jumped in and started creating the meaningful event. PatteriES annually organizes a summer program for pre-stage startup teams and at that time so did three other Entrepreneurship Societies in Finland. We wanted to make *ship a celebration of entrepreneurship for the teams joining these programs.

When Jouni from Cursor offered *ship to PatteriES he wanted to get students themselves to build something for themselves and create a platform that they would be proud of. Also by giving it to an ES to run it, it was then marketed and talked about in the right area. By giving students a voice and a platform, he has given something that would be very hard to do without a lot of help. Jouni has helped so much and is involved in a way so that he is hands on but hands off at the same time which is funny in a way. Now that this is *ship's third year, you can see that Jouni did the right thing by giving it to an ES to manage and it has grown so much over the last three years in to something that everyone involved is proud of.

<div class="article-break">How did you pick the venue for *ship and will it ever be held on a ship?</div>

<p>
The first idea was to do it on a cruiseship. However, we needed more time and investment to be able to organize the event on a ship (like 600K€ of investment). Kotka has a new Maritime Centre called Vellamo, an inspiring and beautiful building. The feeling of this location hooked us immediately and helpful staff of Vellamo made it feel like a home for *ship.

<p>
In year 2017 we will have a different location – with bigger space and new refreshing atmosphere. We are using an old warehouse located by the sea, next to Vellamo. This gives us more room and new possibilities to make the experience even more exciting.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to ships, we do have a lunch cruise where mentors and startups connect with each other in our program.
</p>

<div class="article-break">Will *ship ever visit other cities or countries?</div>
 
<p>
We truly hope that we can take ship all over the world. But next year we will have it in other cities in Finland, guaranteed!
