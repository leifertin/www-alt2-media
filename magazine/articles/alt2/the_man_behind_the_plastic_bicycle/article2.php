<div class="article-break">Is the recycling the same here in Europe as it is in India?</div>

<p>
I would say in Europe to my knowledge, the Netherlands is the only country leading in recycling. In India people have awareness to stop throwing plastics and dusts but they do not have the mindset to recycle yet. Maybe in the future it is possible if some innovative ideas like this are established in India.

<p>
As a student in India, I used to read many journals. Most of the authors of these leading journals with respect to Material Science and plastic are from India. So the research in India is pretty good. The only thing is, the government is not ready to put the green value towards the citizens to motivate them to go towards the green technology. The Netherlands’ government does a really good job of promoting the green technology.

<p>
Finland should do that.

<div class="article-break">With all the raw materials in India, why ship the plastics back and forth?</div>

<p>
The thing is we also have the machines [in India] to do it. The government is not supportive. If it is established in Europe and with that brand of European technology you can just go there to India. That’s what I think.

<div class="article-break">Do you have any sketches of your bicycles yet?</div>

<p>
The thing about sketch and simulation is, it is under privacy. It can not be revealed yet. Just the business plan and one-line pitch. It is a normal cross country bicycle, just a diamond frame, I’m not reinventing the wheel.
</p>

<div class="article-break">What about extras?</div>

<p>
It depends on the customer.
</p>

<div class="article-break">So can you actually customise the bicycle?</div>

<p>
Yeah, why not? Because every component which I am planning to design is in a standard form so even you can replace your metal bicycles with some components of plastics.
</p>

<div class="article-break">So you also make components for other bicycles?</div>

<p>
Yeah, it’s a standard component so you can fit to anything.
</p>

<div class="article-break">As the wheels are being made from plastic as well they deflate? Is there air in it?</div>

<p>
The rims are made out of plastic, but the tire is still rubber, and the rubber is also recycled maybe.

<p>
It means leaf in my language.
