<div class="article-break">When I first started my education in Finland I had no idea what to expect.</div>

<p>
In a land where social benefits reign supreme over a pragmatic society, how could education be free and still be ranked at the top of the worldwide list? After dropping out of a college and a university in the United States, I decided to go all-in. The schoolyard saying is: first is the worst, second is the best, third is the one with the treasure chest. The first was definitely the worst and the treasure chest was indeed full of all kinds of goodies.

Attending college-level classes in the United States was synonymous with paying a teacher to read a book to me. A book that I also had to buy or else be unable to do the work and lose the opportunity to communicate with the teacher. In Finland, these books are free to check out at the school library but even then, most teachers just glance at it occasionally, spending more time going off on their own creative tangent.

Luckily, teachers over here provide a coffee break for each class, sometimes two. I walk downstairs and grab a cup from the cafeteria and am instantly refreshed, especially on a freezing Nordic day. Finland is the leader in coffee consumption, according to <a href="http://nordiccoffeeculture.com/maxed-out-a-closer-look-at-coffee-consumption-in-finland/" target="_blank">Nordic Coffee Culture</a>, and students are no exception. The Finns tend to prefer their coffee very lightly roasted as opposed to Americans who generally order a dark roast. The variance shows its colors in the form of taste and caffeine content - the lighter the roast, the more it will kickstart your heart.

As an International Business student at Xamk (formerly Kyamk), I am undergoing training to become an entrepreneur. Sure there are lessons about dealing with supply chains, financial management, taxes, public relations, business terminology, branding and much, much more, but at the core of this program is one idea - building a company, not joining one. The curriculum underlines the word “networking” at every twist and turn.
</p>

<div class="article-break">Apart from the classes there are multiple after school groups to join.</div>

<p>
Sabine Suorsa introduced our class to “Startup Passion” an organization which helps students (with passion) to bring their dream to life. This group has provided two trips for us to visit the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga, Latvia. From meeting strangers, to collaborating, to developing and pitching, we have been given a nurturing environment in which our ideas flourish. Startup Passion provides this service on a yearly basis.

Ship festival also hosts annual events: Ship Disruption Camp - a two week hackathon and Ship Festival - a chance to pitch your developing business idea to a panel of judges and win a cash prize. Unfortunately I did not participate in Disruption Camp this year but I was present for the Festival in Kotka.

<div class="article-break">Giving a pitch in front of dozens of people is no easy task as public speaking is a very common fear.</div>

<p>
A fear so common in fact, that it has its own name - Glossophobia. According to <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/fear-of-public-speaking-statistics/" target="_blank">Statistic Brain</a>, 74% of people experience this fear. Fortunately my experience in Finland has prepared me to conquer this fear. At Xamk, I had to present in front of the entire class almost on a weekly basis. In Riga, during Startup Passion, I had to pitch in front of an auditorium full of ears and competent judges thrice. So when the day came to verbally deliver our business, Alt2 Media, to the current panel of judges and vast sea of colleagues, the fear had all but vanished.
