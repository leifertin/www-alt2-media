<div class="article-quote">During the last year I have gotten to meet several people who have taken matters into their own hands. Now they are shaping their lives and careers to portray their personal passions. I saw how that affected those people in a positive way. They decided to pursue their passions and became much more confident and certain about who they are. I was so impressed by these entrepreneurs that I wanted to adopt that mindset myself and introduce it to people around me. I believe being a part of FallUp does a great deal in adopting this mindset. <p>-Laura</p></div>

School gives you great skills, but only until a certain point, and for many of us the level in which we are at work might not give us opportunities challenging enough. This is where projects like this come to play a big part — where you get the opportunity to take an ownership of something bigger than you can handle, challenge yourself and show that you can build something amazing. You will not learn until you have a chance to try. For me FallUp has given an amazing playground for numerous things to try, fail and learn. Things I would have not yet been allowed to take ownership of at work, or things I would have never been able to learn at school.

<div class="article-quote">My will to develop drives me and motivates me every day. It’s kind of high-level energy, pushing me forward to the next level. It reminds me to be hungry to learn and grow, but also to be humble enough to realize you’re never finished. <p>-Iida, Member of the marketing team</p></div>

<div class="article-quote">“One of the most crucial things in developing your entrepreneurial mindset is listening. It’s important to surround yourself with people smarter than you and listen to ideas that aren’t yours. I think success takes communication, collaboration, and sometimes failure. These are the things we are learning here. Where most avoid risk, entrepreneurs see potential. Entrepreneurial mindset also means fearless to me.” <p>-Ella, Head of Venue</p></div>

<p>
Our core team has been working numerous hours together throughout the year — and this is one of the beauties that has come along FallUp. Like in any long project, the team “becomes your family” — you learn to work together and get to know the strengths and weaknesses of one another.

<div class="article-quote">Creating FallUp has opened my eyes in many ways; I’ve gathered so much new information and inspiration. We have a really great team full of positive energy, it’s powerful. <p>-Iida</p></div>

The event itself isn’t more than couple months away and we couldn’t be more excited! The experiences we’ve gained so far have been truly one of a kind and it is amazing to see all of the things we planned come together. We hope to see you at the event!

<div class="article-quote">“The best way to develop is getting out of your comfort zone, and there have been a lot of moments like this while creating FallUp. How to sell your ideas to possible partners, how to create something visually enjoyable; how to create something when all you have is a blank paper…The list goes on and on but I’ve learned so much and can’t wait to see the results on the event day!” <p>-Aleksi</p></div>
