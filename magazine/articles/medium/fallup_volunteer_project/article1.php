FallUp is an entirely volunteer run event and this is why in order to deliver a great event, it is even more important to have a great team behind it. And that we sure have this year! Find out why we are organizing FallUp and what our team members want to achieve, not only with the event, but also on a personal level.

<div class="article-break">Why FallUp?</div>

<p>
Aaltoes was founded to make a difference in the attitudes towards entrepreneurship and accelerate the startup scene in Finland. All of our events are important for this goal, but they take a different perspective to the case. FallUp is one of the building blocks in the very foundation of this goal. Driving a change starts with new perspectives, new ideas; a change of mindset. We believe in our very core message — the most important thing in making a change is your mindset. Our aim is to affect as many students as possible — this is how we can achieve our long-term goal, change the thinking among all students.

<p>
Our point of view seems very primal if set beside many other events. We don’t go that deep into founding a business, evolving an idea or validating a product; these are the stages which come to be in other events after our goal is achieved. We want to give the first spark towards entrepreneurship in the minds of students — just like many of us were given in last year’s event.

A successful event (and of course an epic afterparty) is definitely what we are aiming for, but the profound goal is to get people excited about taking matters in their own hands; taking responsibility of their own learning and development. For many, the start for taking more accountable action towards their own career is founding a business, which is, even if not successful, an ultimate learning opportunity. But for all of us, founding a business might be a little bit too big of a step just yet. This is also the case with my own story. I was determined to expedite my self-development, but founding a business was not yet on the table for me, so I joined FallUp. Being accountable for the project is parallel to founding a startup, and definitely a great place to start.

This is the state of mind we want to bring forward and get students excited about. You don’t need to wait for an opportunity to be given or a job to be offered. We want people to get more proactive in going after their dreams and solving the problems faced. This is the way you can become the best version of yourself.

<div class="article-quote">Entrepreneurial mindset to me is about a sense of ownership and responsibility towards both details and the bigger picture as well as curiosity and courage to seize an opportunity. In my life the entrepreneurial mindset shows particularly in attitude. Lately I have found a new, a lot braver, side of me. I am actively looking for opportunities to challenge myself instead of avoiding them and being scared of failing. A failure has become a chance to learn rather than being an embarrassment. I want as many students as possible to have this enlightenment. <p>-Laura, Head of Partnership</p></div>

Putting together and delivering a successful, inspiring event isn’t the only goal of our project, like it’s not the only goal for any project inside Aaltoes. Our entire team is learning and developing the same things we want our audience and fellow students to pay attention to. The will to join to make an event like FallUp happen says a lot about the person’s mindset — their point of view towards learning and self-development. All of us are in this project because we are on our own paths towards our greatest selves.
