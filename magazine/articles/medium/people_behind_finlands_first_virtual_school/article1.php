When I go to Finland, one of my favorite work-related things is meeting with Finnish educators who are researching and building new innovative learning environments. This time I drove up to the Lake Saimaa to discuss with Sanna Metsälä and Aleksi Komu from Savonlinna Teacher Training School. The school runs a two-year program called Koulu 360 (School 360) aiming to develop Finland’s first virtual school. Here is a summary of the key principles it relies on:

<p>
The Savonlinna Teacher Training School is Finland’s first unified basic education school that uses tablet computers more than textbooks. In several subjects textbooks are not used at all. Next, the school is planning a large-scale adoption of virtual reality headsets for all its students. Still, the school’s headmaster Mikko Ripatti says investing in information and communication technology alone is not enough.

<p>
Emphasizing student’s role in content production, the concept of virtual school in Savonlinna is based on the principles and practices of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_inquiry" target="_blank">progressive inquiry</a> (see <a href="http://ikit.org/people/MTO_Kai.htm" target="_blank">Hakkarainen</a> 2003) and <a href="https://www.enterpriseinnovation.net/article/how-finland-building-schools-future-309928159" target="_blank">project-based working</a>. In a progressive inquiry process, the teacher creates a context for inquiry by presenting a multidisciplinary approach to a theoretical or real-life phenomenon, after which the students start defining their own questions and intuitive working theories about it. Project based working and phenomena-based learning refer to an approach where students focus on actual real-world topics from an interdisciplinary perspective, such as the European Union, human rights, and climate change. Students approach the topics comprehensively from different points of view, crossing the boundaries between traditional school subjects and integrating different themes.

Examples of student projects include sharing a <a href="https://www.thinglink.com/video/847736810955079681" target="_blank">cultural path of the City of Savonlinna to a friendship school in the US</a>, creating art and history tours of Savonlinna’s <a href="https://www.thinglink.com/video/896659121648959490" target="_blank">statues</a> and Lusto <a href="https://www.thinglink.com/video/900644554976264193" target="_blank">museum</a>, and shooting a 360 version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_and_the_Pea" target="_blank">Hans Christian Andersen’s The Princess and the Pea</a> <a href="https://www.thinglink.com/video/906066163618807811" target="_blank">in the old castle of Savonlinna.</a>

“In our school, and in the new Finnish curriculum more broadly, students are seen as active content creators and learners who brainstorm, plan, and produce learning environments for virtual reality”, says Sanna Metsälä. “In addition, we see it is important to encourage the kind of student participation that gives them confidence and makes them believe in their own skills and capabilities”.

<p>
The pedagogical starting point of the project is to strengthen student creation oriented pedagogy. This means the objective is for students is to learn to create content independently, and to adopt the knowledge and skills they gain during the project. Savonlinna is also pioneering research on how the integration of virtual reality and 360 content creation in teaching affects students’ motivation and learning outcomes. Research on the topic is still very scarce, so it will be fascinating to hear the first findings from this project!
