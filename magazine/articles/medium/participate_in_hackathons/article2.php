In our project <a href="https://devpost.com/software/sutoju" target="_blank">sutoju</a> we built a smart scale to track food waste behavior and created a personal assistant that suggest recipes you can make with the soon-to-expire ingredients you have at home, so your food doesn’t spoil. We used new technologies that we wanted to learn and pushed ourselves over our expectations. We didn’t have the proper components for a scale so we had to build them on our own. We forgot to bring a web camera, so we had to learn how to use Pepper instead. Deep learning, IoT, and robotics crammed into a weekend. Again, we won our track and the main prize. Woot.

is what we looked for in Tokyo. It’s a huge difference to the reasons I had for my very first hack. Some people wouldn’t want to associate competitiveness with hackathons. I do, since I have always enjoyed being competitive. Right now I feel inspired by my own team and motivated by the competition against other teams. That’s what makes me want to participate in my next hackathon. So what about you?

I think this is the most important take-away from hackathons. Set your expectations high and be ready to exceed them. It doesn’t matter if you’re a first-timer with a new technology or an experienced developer looking for new challenges. You will find a hackathon that suits your needs. In my opinion, the ultimate hackathon experience should feel distressing and occasionally even obnoxious. I like competing against other teams by working together with my friends, but that’s just me. Others feel that every team in a hackathon is collaborating towards a common goal. That’s important as well, I agree. The great thing about hackathons is that you will feel welcome no matter what kind of mindset drives you into participating. In the end, having a good time is what matters. It’s fine if you want to chill and find new friends, enjoy free food in an exciting environment or just experience something completely new.

<div class="article-break">Hackathons are a beautiful mixture of people with different backgrounds and a common passion.</div>

<p>
They are not just an event. They are a new mindset of solving a problem by focusing on what matters. Working together towards a common goal. Proving a point by getting stuff done. My reasons for participating in hackathons might be different than yours, but that doesn’t matter. Having the possibility of breaking boundaries by experimenting with technology is exciting, no matter what.

This year we want to bring the excitement we have for hackathons also to FallUp. Self-development and reaching the next level is one of the main reasons for participating in hackathons and it is also the core message behind FallUp. At this year’s FallUp you will have a chance to meet the Junction crew and take a part in our coding workshop. Let’s hack your mindset to a whole new level!
