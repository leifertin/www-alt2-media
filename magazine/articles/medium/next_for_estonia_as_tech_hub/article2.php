<div class="article-break">While attracting talent has always been Estonia’s main strength, there are still some challenges that need to be resolved to ensure that this continues to be one of their key advantages.</div>

<p>
For example, while there’s clearly a deep pool of technical talent, there is still a lack of marketing and business focused skills on the ground, meaning that Estonian companies typically need to look outside for this. This often means setting up satellite offices elsewhere to compensate, something that Pipedrive has been doing recently.

<div class="article-break">There’s also the problem that all ecosystems face:</div>

<p>
Talent is a finite resource, and with a relatively small population, this limit can be reached reasonably quickly, with increased amounts of local startups and foreign companies establishing development centers. Still, with the startup visa and even the e-residency programme, they are better placed than most to deal with this issue.

Although Skype’s exit bought money back into the ecosystem, with many new Estonian companies benefiting from angel investments from former Skype personnel, there is still a lack of local early-stage funding options, with Estonian companies having to typically look to the United States or elsewhere in Europe to raise a seed round. Things are improving here with Estonian companies seemingly finding it easier to raise than ever before. There was a 50% increase in the number of funding rounds in 2016 compared to just two years prior, according to <a href="https://dealroom.co/" target="_blank">Dealroom</a>, demonstrating that things are moving in the right direction.

All of the factors discussed in our panels and outlined in this post make a strong case for Tallinn continuing to punch above its weight and produce more companies like Skype. Companies like Pipedrive, Jobbatical and Testlio are all demonstrating strong traction, and proof of a capable new generation able to follow in the footsteps of where Skype once stepped. Although some challenges remain, in general conditions are favourable for those in Estonia both looking to start new companies and those who are already on their journey. At Atomico, we firmly believe that great companies can be built from anywhere — Estonia is strongly positioned to be that ‘anywhere’.
