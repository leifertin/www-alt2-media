At <a href="http://atomico.com/" target="_blank">Atomico</a>, we’ve long-believed in the great potential for business success in Europe. Since we launched in 2006, Atomico has been banging the drum for the strength of the European ecosystem. Throughout, Estonia has played a key part in the Atomico story, with Niklas having established Skype there back in 2003 and continuing to the present day with our recent investment in <a href="https://www.pipedrive.com/en-gb">Pipedrive</a>.

We see the present moment as an inflection point for the tech ecosystem there: funding amounts are heading in the right direction, Tallinn has a greater density of startups per capita than many of the more traditionally revered European hubs, Estonia has a higher density of developers than any other EU country, and of course, with a small domestic market, Estonian startups are all born with an international outlook hardwired into their DNA.

<div class="article-break">But where does it go from here?</div>

<p>
No ecosystem can remain static, after all, if it hopes to succeed. Recently, we held an event in Tallinn where we hosted two panels, asking the ‘old’ and ‘new’ faces of the Estonian startup ecosystem how they thought the scene could scale.

<p>
What became abundantly clear from the discussions is that Skype still plays an important role even today, with Sten Tamviki speculating that of the 400 or so startups in Estonia right now, 70–80% of them have a connection to Skype, a concentration of network, talent and capital that typically only exists in Silicon Valley.

Jaan Tallinn, one of the co-founders, likened Skype to “A bootcamp for engineers and entrepreneurs, giving an excellent grounding in the skills and principles needed to develop and scale a world-leading company.”

Skype showed Estonians that it was possible to build a global company and a sense of “If they can do it, so can I”. With its aforementioned small domestic market, Estonians need to think globally from the outset, although Martin Henk, co-founder of Pipedrive, did make the point that he felt that too many Estonians were concentrating on problems that aren’t big enough and, as Niklas pointed out from an investor point of view, bigger ideas are actually less risky; the likelihood of failure is about the same, but the potential rewards and benefits are so much greater.

Not only did Skype’s success have a direct impact on Estonians, it also played a vital role in opening up the country internationally, with talent from all over the world coming to work for Skype, providing a huge opportunity to develop the local ecosystem and benefit from the knowledge and talent that comes with a diverse influx of nationalities and skills. In fact, Estonia has the highest percentage in Europe of startup hires who get a visa; making it easier to attract a global workforce to Estonian businesses and providing them with a unique advantage over other hubs; after all, attracting talent is arguably the biggest challenge for most of the major tech hubs in Europe.

This has been the most direct contribution from a government that is extremely supportive of the tech scene, and one which sets a strong example as to how other governments in Europe could assist with supporting and fuelling their own ecosystems. Estonia’s latest innovation is the much-publicised e-residency programme which allows anyone to become an Estonian e-citizen, enabling them to register and start new businesses online.
