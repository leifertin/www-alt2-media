							Hey!
						</p>
						<p>
							We are still getting everything set up and experiencing the hurdles of creating a company from scratch, but our spirits are still high! Currently we are contacting businesses and authors for more content to provide to you. To better serve our market we are discussing the possibility of providing translated articles.
						</p>
						<p>
							We have gone from 4 social networks to 6! We now have pages on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Medium, and YouTube. Now why YouTube you may ask? For some articles we are looking into providing videos; starting with interviews and more to come in time. Not only are we posting articles on social media, but we are also using that space for less serious things like memes. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							There is also a survey on our site (click the hand at the top of the page). This asks a few questions as to how we can improve our work. If you have a couple minutes we would really appreciate your input!
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Our team is currently split across 3 countries so weekly meetings are a bit difficult. After a long summer, university started back up for some of us, so while it brings our team into closer proximity, we may have less time for the company. We have been working very long hours each week to get our company online and don't intend on stopping anytime soon!
						</p>
						
						<p>
							But I think I've been talking long enough for now. Thank you for reading and see you again next month!
						</p>
