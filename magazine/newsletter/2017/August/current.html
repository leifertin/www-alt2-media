						<h2>Why SHIP* movement?</h2>
<p>
Students, wherever you are, whoever you are, whatever fields you specialize in, SHIP is a playground just for you. 
</p>
<p>
If you are not prepared, we will prepare you.<br> 
If you need a direction, we will give you one.<br>
If you need a team, we will introduce you to one.
</p>
<p>
Are you ready for some “disruptive” adventure?<br>
Step out of your comfort zone and hop on our ship!
</p>
<p>
I will give you a few reasons why you should join our camp.
Firstly, we are not here to work 24/7, this camp is organized for people who want to have fun while working. It might sound strange and illogical but I am confident that I can convince you to believe what I have to say.
If you are wondering about the word “disruption”, worry not, I am here to help you with everything. Pressure can be applied in many situations to motivate people but do you agree with me fun is way better and healthier? That is one way of defining disruption. The word itself has a powerful meaning, think of how many ways you can come up with to solve an algebra, you can do them same with explaining the definition of “disruption”. Here at SHIP, we are very much fond of a healthy routine, we like to have fun, we want to have fun and we create a joyful working environment for each other. Would you like to try and invent one for your own and help others build their own? Don’t be afraid of changes, we change for the greater good. Don’t hesitate to bring disruption in to existence. You are unique, your ways of thinking are distinctive, you are disruptive already. You are creativity.
</p>
<p>
But then have you ever asked yourself how to become more creative? if yes, from where do you get the inspiration to do such thing? If no, what should you do?
</p>
<p>
I think everybody is an inspiration to one another, maybe you haven’t realized that your graphic design works inspires 5 complete strangers yet but the fact that you love what you are doing has already made an impact on other people to find their own motivation. Why am I talking about inspiration instead of creativity? Because to us, inspiration is one of the factors that will contribute a big part of you becoming disruptive. And if you are lost, we are here to give you a direction with open-minds and open arms. At SHIP, you are inspiring and being inspired.
</p>
<p>
With such motivation and your amazing character, you will grow in the most incredible way that you can think of. You will start looking things at different perspectives and thinking more boldly. You are developing your new skills, you handle problem more flexible. With specific skills set, you are able to cope with new challenges. And are you excited if you can show your skills in actual company’s cases? 
</p>
<p>
We provide you with direct company contact as well as your space so you can freely express your personalities, your abilities, your leadership. The local companies around the Kotka area are always looking for young talents, it is not necessarily that you have to be young to be eligible to participate, all we are looking for is the youth, the passion, young souls, adventurous minds and devoted hands.
</p>
<p>
And guess what? You will not be working alone, we will introduce you to a team with different people with very diverse skills and different specialization, just like you are. We believe in the power of team work, friendship, fellowship and leadership here that we want to give the best environment to work in, the best tools to work with and the best people that you can learn from working together. This way not only can you enjoy your working hours but also create your own network with everyone. The more people you have beside you, the more disruptive you all can become. You are all different with a variety of personalities, abilities and together, you make possibilities reality. You are a part of the greatness to the future.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, your hard work will be certified. You will receive your hard earn credits from your disruption. Yes, at SHIP, if we can be disruptive about the way we work then we can be the same in encouraging all of the amazingness that you all brought on board with us. We appreciate you in the heart, in the mind and on the paper too!
